# Loan Prediction Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview:
This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to loan prediction. The objective is to analyze various factors that may influence loan approval decisions and explore machine learning models to predict loan approval status based on given features.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset). It contains information about loan applicants, including their demographic details, financial attributes, and loan approval status.

## Analysis:
The EDA process involves:

1. **Data Exploration:** Understanding the structure and content of the dataset, exploring distributions of variables, and identifying any missing or outlier values.

2. **Visualization:** Creating visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and pie charts to analyze relationships between variables and identify trends and patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Manipulating and transforming features to extract relevant information and improve model performance.

## Machine Learning Models:
Three different machine learning algorithms are evaluated for loan prediction:

1. **Logistic Regression:** A binary classification algorithm used to model the probability of loan approval based on input features.

2. **Decision Tree:** A versatile algorithm that partitions the feature space into regions and makes decisions based on simple rules inferred from the data.

3. **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

## Testing and Training:
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of machine learning models. Cross-validation is used to assess the generalization performance of the models and ensure stability and consistency in performance across different subsets of the data.

## Results:
- Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of 77.27% and a cross-validation score of 80.78%.
- Decision Tree: Achieved an accuracy of 70.78% and a cross-validation score of 71.67%.
- Random Forest Classifier: Achieved an accuracy of 77.92% and a cross-validation score of 78.83%.

## Conclusion:
The analysis provides valuable insights into factors influencing loan approval decisions and the performance of different machine learning models for loan prediction. Further optimization and fine-tuning of models can be explored to improve prediction accuracy and enhance decision-making processes in loan approval.
