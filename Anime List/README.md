# Anime Recommendation System

This notebook presents a data analysis and implementation of a recommendation system for anime based on the [Anime Recommendations Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database) available on Kaggle.

## Introduction

The project aims to explore the anime dataset and build a recommendation system to suggest anime titles to users based on their preferences and viewing history.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- Loading and initial exploration of the anime dataset and rating dataset.
- Handling missing values and cleaning the data.
- Feature engineering: Deriving new features or transforming existing ones.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualizing the distribution of anime types, genres, and ratings.
- Analyzing user ratings and community size for different anime titles.
- Investigating correlations between variables and identifying patterns in the data.
- Exploring the popularity of different anime genres and types.

## Building the Recommendation System

- Choosing a recommendation algorithm based on the nature of the dataset and project goals.
- Preparing the data for recommendation: creating user-item matrices, normalizing data if required.
- Implementing the recommendation algorithm using Python libraries like scikit-learn.
- Evaluating the performance of the recommendation system using relevant metrics.
